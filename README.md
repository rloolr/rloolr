**Hi there, I'm Rafael and this my Github's Personal Page**

A little about me . . . I have 10 years of experience in IT and recently I have been looking for knowledge about DevOps culture through knowledge sources such as books, videos, tools etc.

I am a team player. I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time.
